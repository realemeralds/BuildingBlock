            Web1.0 is created to be static and centralised and consumers are
            only able to search for information online. Information cannot be
            edited (Read-Only). Internet, msn and yahoo are examples of Web1.0.
            <br />
            <br />
            Implemention have been made from Web1.0 to Web2.0 as a interactive
            and centralised space for everyone. This allows consumers to
            comment,edit as well as interact with one another online
            (Read-Write). Some of the examples include Facebook, Instagram and
            Twitter.
            <br />
            <br />
            Moving Forward, Web3.0 has been launched in 2020 as a space where it
            is verifiable and decentralised. This suggests that consumers are
            able to own what they have created online. Bitcoin is one of the
            example.

            Web3.0 technologies like blockchain provide several benefits,
            especially in terms of data privacy and security. Blockchain itself
            has a proven high level of security for simple use cases (e.g.
            sending transactions from one person to another).

          <p className="textHeading">Misconception of Web3.0</p>
          <p className="textBodyMain">
            Misconception 1: “Web3.0” Is the Same Thing as “The Metaverse”. The
            metaverse is just a small sector within Web3.0 while Web3.0 is
            all-encompassing.
            <br />
            <br />
            Misconception 2: Web3.0 Is 100% Decentralized. Numerous Web3.0
            platforms are centralized, meaning that they have owners who control
            access. For example, the OpenSea NFT marketplace is actually
            centralized.
            <br />
            <br />
            Misconception 3: Web3.0 Is More Secure than Web2. Applications that
            use emerging types of Web3.0 technologies aren’t nearly as secure.
            For example, smart contracts used to power Web3 applications can be
            exploited.
