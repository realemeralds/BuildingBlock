      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Imagine a virtual world in which you can live, work, shop, and interact with people from around the world, bringing new levels of social interaction, mobility, and collaboration. This is known as the metaverse.

From games to events to even actual employment, a new digital world of economic opportunity is opened by the Metaverse. But what exactly is the Metaverse? Is it only a digital space? Can you enter it if you have a computer at hand or do you have to wear a fancy device?

But perhaps more importantly, what is the full potential of the Metaverse? Can we live a fully digital life, or does it simply complement our physical lives?

In this programme, participants will explore a range of Metaverses powered by augmented and virtual reality and discover potential disruptions within existing industries that the Metaverse will bring. Additionally, participants will be able to learn about Metaverse's potential for businesses and society, as well as participate in the future of human communication.</p>

  <h3 class="w3-left">Basic introduction of web3 </h3>
  <p class="w3-left w3-small"> 
  (1) Dale Dougherty, a vice president at O&#39;Reilly Media, came up with the idea for
Web 2.0 in a brainstorming session in preparation for a conference. The conference
focused on the state of the World Wide Web after the collapse of several Internet
companies in 2001. <br>
  (2) The Semantic Web is another term some people use for Web 3.0. Ideally, the
Semantic Web will be able to interpret user input and tailor the Web surfing
experience to make it more relevant and personal.<br>
(3) An API is an application programming interface. Many Web 2.0 sites provide an
API so that third-party developers can create applications using the respective site
as a platform. Facebook is a good example of a site that developers use as an
application platform. <br>
(4) Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. The first Web site was
for the CERN nuclear research institute. <br>
(5) In the world of the Internet, an ontology is a collection of information that
defines the relationships between different terms. A comprehensive Web ontology is
necessary for accurate, relevant Web surfing experiences.<br>
(6) Metadata is information within a Web page&#39;s code that&#39;s invisible to humans but
visible to computers. Web page designers can use metadata to help computers
understand the content found inside a Web page.<br>
(7) With distributed computing, computer scientists create a network of machines
that work together to solve large computational problems. Each computer works on a
small part of the problem.<br>
(8) A contextual Web search engine is able to not only search for Web pages that
use certain key words, but also understand what those key words mean.<br>
(9) The Web 3.0 browser will act like a personal assistant, retrieving information for
you and even offering suggestions you may not have thought about while searching
for information.<br>
(10) Every Web 3.0 user will have a personal browsing profile. The Web browser
will learn about the user during each browsing session. As the browser gets to know
the user, it will return personalized results. That means even if two people search for
the exact same term, they may see totally different search results based on their
respective Web 3.0 profiles.<br>

  <h3 class="w3-left">Definition of important and essential jargons for web3</h3>
  <p class="w3-left w3-small"> 
 Augmented reality (AR). A technology that combines elements of virtual reality (VR) with physical reality. In its current form, AR can be facilitated by devices worn over the eyes – such as glasses or goggles – or by a smartphone or computer screen. Pokémon Go is one common example of AR, because it blends virtual information with one’s physical environment.

Avatar. An avatar is a digital rendering of a human being or other entity in VR, a video game, the internet or another virtual space.

Bitcoin is at the time of writing the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. It was also the world’s very first cryptocurrency, postulated by ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ (which is typically presumed to be a pseudonym) in a now-famous white paper called ‘A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’ in 2008.

Blockchain. A ‘blockchain’ is a distributed digital ledger that’s used to record transactions. It’s an immutable database, which means that information can’t be tampered with or altered once it’s been recorded. (If there’s an error in an entry, then a new, revised entry must be made, and both entries will subsequently be visible on the ledger.)The name comes from the fact that a blockchain stores data in ‘blocks,’ individual units that are linked, or ‘chained,’ together. New data is filed into blocks – and blocks are subsequently chained together – in chronological order, so a blockchain becomes longer and longer as more information is added to it. Each new piece of information is also assigned a timestamp, which makes it easy for users to find out exactly when it was linked to the database. The transparency and immutability of the blockchain makes it a very reliable and trustworthy business resource both for individuals and companies.

Block. A block, the constituent element of a blockchain, is an individual unit in which data is stored.

Centralized system. This is a system that is controlled and organized according to a rigid hierarchical structure. In such a system, power and decision-making authority is concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of individuals at the top of the hierarchy. Corporations, for example, are centralized systems.

Cryptography. A word derived from the Greek ‘kryptos’ meaning ‘hidden’ – this is the process of using mathematics to encode and protect sensitive information from malicious actors.

DAO. A Decentralized Autonomous Organization, colloquially referred to as a ‘DAO,’ is an organization that is controlled by its members and not subject to the authority of any single individual or entity. Unlike a traditional corporation or government, they are completely free of hierarchical, top-down structure. Its codes of conduct are recorded on a blockchain to ensure transparency and decentralization. Participation in a DAO is usually accessed through the acquisition of a digital token.

Dapp. A decentralized application, colloquially called a dapp, is an application constructed on the blockchain. Dapps function autonomously, according to the stipulations in smart contracts. Like any other application on your phone, dapps come with a user interface and are designed to provide some kind of practical utility.
DeFi. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, refers to a financial system built upon the blockchain, and therefore fully distributed and not subject to any centralized authority, such as a bank, government agency or a financial management firm.

Digital twin. This is a virtual rendering of a physical object. But a digital twin is more than a mere three-dimensional simulacrum – they’re designed, ideally, to be as dynamic and environment-dependent as the objects they’re imitating.

For example, let’s say a team of engineers is making structural improvements to a bridge. They could design a simulation of that bridge, a simple 3D model, which would allow them to make basic measurements and study the overall structure. But that simulation wouldn’t be able to tell them much about how the wind, the traffic or any other number of more subtle environmental factors have been impacting the integrity of the bridge. To study those processes, they might distribute sensors over the bridge in order to create a digital twin. This would allow the team to create a much more informative model.

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network built by Vitalik Buterin in 2015. The open-source network is home to its native cryptocurrency, also called Ethereum but more commonly known simply as Ether or ETH (there’s some debate about whether it’s pronounced ‘eth’ or ‘eeth’). The Ethereum platform also gave rise to smart contracts – a subject we’ll dive into another week. As of March, ETH is the second most-valuable cryptocurrency in the world, after Bitcoin.

Extended reality. Also commonly referred to as ‘XR,’ extended reality is a category of multiple technologies – including VR, AR and mixed reality (MR) – which, in various ways, blend virtual worlds with physical reality.

Fiat money. Not to be confused with the car brand, fiat money is a term used to refer to any kind of currency that has been declared a legal tender by a government body. (The declaration itself is often called a fiat.) Fiat money isn’t backed by any intrinsically valuable commodity, such as precious metals like gold and silver. Instead, the value of fiat money is determined by the fluctuations of supply and demand. Paper money, like the US dollar, is fiat money.

Fiat money is subject to an economic force called ‘variable supply,’ which means the governing body that issued the fiat can control its value by tweaking a variety of levers, such as the adjustment of interest rates. Cryptocurrency, which is not subject to the authority of any centralized authority, is often positioned as the opposite of fiat money.

Fungibility. A term used in economics to refer to a commodity that is precisely equal in value and therefore exchangeable with other identical versions of that same commodity. A $1 bill, for example, is fungible, because it can be exchanged for any other $1 bill – they have the same value and therefore, for all intents and purposes, are identical.

Gas. In the context of web3, gas refers to a fee that’s required in order to execute a smart contract or transaction on Ethereum blockchain. Gas, which is often denominated in a very tiny fraction of an ETH called a WEI, is paid to node operators, AKA miners.

Gwei. The smallest denomination of the cryptocurrency ETH is called Gwei. 1 ETH is worth 1bn Gwei.

HODL is a common acronym used in the crypto space, which stands for ‘hold on for dear life.’ It’s typically invoked at times when the crypto market is undergoing some dramatic fluctuations and investors are feeling nervous, as in: “Don’t sell just yet, the markets will recover and your investments will bounce back if you just HODL.”

IRL. Shorthand for ‘in real life,’ IRL is an acronym commonly used in the web3 space to describe a person, place, thing or event in physical – as opposed to virtual – reality.
Liquidity is a term used in economics to describe the degree to which an asset can be converted into either cash or some other asset.
A main network, or mainnet, is a finalized version of a blockchain that is fully developed and available for public use.
Meatspace refers to the physical world, ie the tangible counterpart to the virtual world of the metaverse. It may not be the most elegant of terms, but it’s been catching on among tech circles.
Meta. Facebook, Inc changed its name to Meta (officially Meta Platforms, Inc) as part of the company’s pivot toward the metaverse. There are many who mistakenly believe that the metaverse is a technology owned by Meta.

MetaMask is a software built for the Ethereum blockchain that functions as a crypto wallet.

Metaverse. ‘The metaverse’ is not synonymous with ‘web3.’ The former is the virtual landscape that’s accessible via VR technology, whereas the latter is a term that’s commonly used to describe the next evolutionary stage of the internet. ‘Web3’ is inclusive of blockchain, cryptocurrency, the metaverse and other emergent technologies.

Minting is a term used to describe the process of registering a digital asset on the blockchain, thereby turning it into a purchasable non-fungible token (NFT). Once a NFT has been minted – given the nature of the blockchain – it cannot be altered. Minting NFTs on the blockchain requires a vast amount of energy, which has led many to criticize the blockchain and its proponents.

Mixed reality, also known as MR, is a technology that fuses VR with physical reality and also allows for the interaction between those two worlds. In other words: in MR, input from the physical environment directly affects the output that the user receives from the virtual world.

NFT. A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a collection of data stored on a blockchain that is non-interchangeable – in other words, it can’t be replicated into multiple copies of equal value in the same way that, say, US quarters can be replicated and exchanged with one another. (See definition for ‘fungible’ above.)

NGMI is a popular slang acronym in the NFT space, meaning ‘not gonna make it,’ and used to refer to a campaign or specific token that is unlikely to attain a high value. Its opposite, WGMI – ‘we’re gonna make it’ – is also commonly used.

P2P. Peer-to-peer, or P2P, is a term used to describe a network of individual computers exchanging information with one another without the oversight of a central server. Management of a P2P network is distributed among its constituent computers.

PAOP. A Proof of Attendance Protocol, or POAP, is a virtual token that serves as evidence – also commonly called a ‘badge’ – that an individual attended, either virtually or IRL, a particular event.

Private key, in crypto-speak, is an alphanumeric code that must be entered by a user in order to access one’s wallet or authorize an exchange of blockchain-based assets or currency.

Proof of Stake, or PoS, is a system for validating transactions and establishing new blocks in the blockchain. It’s consensus-based mechanism, with each validator’s role in the process being directly proportional to the size of their stake in the cryptocurrency that’s involved in the transaction.

Proof of Work, or PoW, is another system for establishing consensus and building new blocks in the blockchain. A PoW mechanism requires each participant in a cryptographic process to submit proof that they have expended a certain amount of contributory computational effort.

Public key is an alphanumeric code that’s connected with a particular wallet. Analogous to a bank account number, a public key is the code that other users would input to send assets directly into your wallet.

Redpilled is a slang term used to describe a situation in which someone’s worldview – or their perspective on a specific issue – has undergone a sudden and dramatic shift. The phrase refers to the famous red pill from The Matrix film franchise, which basically symbolizes the decision to swallow a hard and uncomfortable truth about oneself or about the nature of reality.

Smart contracts are blockchain-based computer programs that are designed to automatically go into effect as soon as the parties privy to the contract have fulfilled their respective obligations. Once they’ve been coded and their terms have been agreed upon, they become fully automated, which negates the need for any facilitating third party. Because they’re built upon the blockchain, transactions made via smart contracts can be closely monitored – but can’t be tampered with after the fact – by the parties involved.

A test network, or testnet, is a blockchain where developers can test the functionality of new protocols, before activating them on a mainnet.

Tokenomics, a blending of the words ‘token’ and economics, is an umbrella term that refers to all of the various qualities of a virtual currency that can cause its market value to fluctuate.

TradFi is tongue-in-cheek shorthand that some in the crypto community use to refer to ‘traditional finance’ – basically the pre-DeFi paradigm of centralized financial authority, in which governments, banks and other institutions control and regulate currency.

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that creates three-dimensional, immersive digital environments, wherein visitors can interact with other people (or rather, their avatars) and other elements of the environment. VR technology, though still in its infancy, has been advancing rapidly. Meta’s Oculus Quest headset is an example of a piece of hardware that can transport the wearer to VR worlds.

Wallet. A crypto wallet is an application that stores and protects the keys to blockchain-based assets and accounts. (See definitions for ‘private key’ and ‘public key’ above.)

  <h3 class="w3-left">Design your own static website </h3>
  <p class="w3-left w3-small"> 
  1. How long does it take to code a website?
Answer: it depends on the complexity of your website. For example, it will take a lot
less time to launch a basic homepage with your business&#39;s address, contact
information, and links to social media accounts than it will to build an online ordering
portal that collects users&#39; shipping information and processes payments.
However, just because you save time in the beginning doesn&#39;t mean that more
advanced features aren&#39;t worthwhile. It depends on your business. If you are only
trying to get foot traffic to your store, then online ordering doesn&#39;t make sense.
That said, you may miss out on customers that may not feel like driving to a physical
location but would purchase through your website. If you don&#39;t have the bandwidth to
ship items to your customers, then that&#39;s another good reason to pass on creating an
ecommerce website.
2. Do I need to code my website?
Simple answer: no. While everyone was manually coding their sites in the early days
of the internet, many websites are now built with a content management system
(CMS). A CMS removes the need to code by offering a visual interface to build web
pages and structure your site. Many CMSs offer drag-and-drop capabilities so that
you can easily position elements (e.g. a button) where you want them on the
page. Libraries of CMS templates can even help to create responsive websites,
without coding, that are compatible for all device types.

Our team has compiled a list of the best CMSs that I recommend reading if you&#39;d
rather avoid the custom coding route. If you&#39;re ready to learn some code, let’s walk
through this process together.

1. Pick your code editor.
Code editors are a great tool for new developers because they offer many features
that make our lives easier. For example, Visual Studio Code (my choice) will offer
syntax suggestions so you can avoid simple typos that cause issues in your code.
On top of that, it will autocomplete closing tags for HTML and add visual markers to
your files so that you can easily tell different pieces of code apart.
You can see the difference between a regular text editor and a code editor below.
The code works the same in both documents, but one is much easier to understand
at a glance than the other.
As I said before, Visual Studio Code is my preferred tool, but there are many free
code editors out there for you to choose from. Visual Studio Code has extensions
that add additional functions to the editor (like switching from dark to light mode) and
a dedicated user base that is constantly creating more, but the most important thing
is that you have a code editor for these next steps. The brand is not critical.
Note: I will be sharing screenshots from Visual Studio Code, so it will be easy to
follow along in this tool as we dive into coding in the next step.

2. Write your HTML.
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. If that doesn&#39;t make sense right now,
don&#39;t worry. Focus less on the definition and more on this picture: we&#39;re building a
house. The most natural place to start is with the foundation, walls, and roof because
every house needs these before you worry about interior decorating or painting.
With HTML, we&#39;re able to build this structure for our website. This is a metaphor I
use when I lead HTML and CSS trainings, so we&#39;ll repurpose it for this tutorial as
well. Now that we have the right tool for the job and understand our goal, it&#39;s time to
dive into the reason you&#39;re here: coding.

Create an HTML doc.

All of our coding will happen in different files that we save to our local machine. The
first file that we&#39;ll create is our HTML document. To start, make a new folder for your
website files. Since I am demoing, I creatively named mine &quot;demo.&quot;

Now open the folder in your code editor. Next, create a file named &quot;index.html&quot; and
we now have our very first HTML file ready to go. Note that you do not need to name
your file &quot;index&quot; but you do need to match the &quot;.html&quot; file extension. This tells our
computer (and later our web browser) that this is an HTML document instead of a
JPG, PDF, etc.
Our file is currently blank, so let&#39;s add the HTML document structure. I have laid
everything out in the snippet below so you can copy and paste into your file (or write
it out).
et&#39;s review each of these pieces briefly:
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: A declaration to the browser that this is an HTML
document type which will tell it how to process our code
 &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;: An opening tag to wrap all of our HTML so the browser
knows where our code starts and where it ends (note the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag)
 &lt;head&gt;: An opening tag to contain all the nonvisible information about our
web page, also known as metadata — we&#39;ll go over this in the next part (note
the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag)
 &lt;body&gt;: An opening tag to contain all the visible content on our web page —
we&#39;ll add elements to this later in this section (note the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag)
Note: If you&#39;re not as familiar with HTML syntax, I recommend our HTML guide as a
good way to brush up on your skills before continuing.

Add metadata to your head.
Metadata is defined as data about the data. In the scope of our HTML document,
think of it as information about the document for the web browser. It is housed under
the &lt;head&gt;, which separates our metadata from the &lt;body&gt; where our content will
live (keep this in mind for the next section). Let&#39;s add some metadata under
our &lt;head&gt;.
the &lt;title&gt; HTML element tells the browser what we&#39;d like our web page to be
named. For example, if I launch my file, we&#39;ll see &quot;Stephen&#39;s Website&quot; in the browser
tab:
Don&#39;t worry about understanding the &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; tag for now. Just
know that it is a web development best practice to include it in your &lt;head&gt;.
Add content to your body.

Now that we have our metadata squared away, I&#39;ve gone ahead and added content
to our web page so we (finally) have something to look at. You can see the updated
HTML under the &lt;body&gt; on the left and what the user will see on the right.
Let&#39;s review each of these new elements briefly:
 &lt;h1&gt;: The main title for our web page. HTML has heading levels 1-6 (i.e.
&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt;). It will display the largest by default since it&#39;s given the most
weight (we&#39;ll learn how to manipulate displays when we get to CSS), and it&#39;s a
best practice to only have one &lt;h1&gt; on a page.
 &lt;p&gt;: A paragraph element.
 &lt;img&gt;: An image element. Note that &lt;img&gt; has no closing tag. This is
because it has no text to wrap around (which &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;p&gt; do).
Before we continue, I want to take a moment to discuss HTML attributes. We can
see two different examples inside the img tag. First, &quot;src&quot; is an attribute for the
image source that tells the browser which image to display. Second, &quot;alt&quot; is an
attribute for alternate text that tells the browser what text to display if the image can&#39;t
be rendered. Alt text is also important for accessibility so that screen readers can
describe the image to users.
Note: the order of the attributes inside your HTML tag does not matter as long as
they are all inside the tag.
Check your work.
If you&#39;ve made it this far, you&#39;re probably excited to see your hard work on the big
screen (AKA web browser). The simplest way to do this is to return to your File
Explorer and right click your HTML file:
Once you&#39;ve selected your web browser of choice (I recommend Chrome, but any
will work), you should see your HTML file displaying like it&#39;s a live web page. Don&#39;t
worry, only you can see it for now.

3. Create your CSS stylesheet.
Let&#39;s return to the metaphor from the last section. We now have our house&#39;s
structure. But you may have noticed that — like the clipart house graphic — our
HTML is uniform and lacks color. We can see all of it, but clearly there&#39;s a lot more
that can be done with HTML than its default display. We&#39;ll turn to CSS to give our
&quot;house&quot; some flair.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with CSS, I recommend
starting with our CSS guide to review the finer points of properties, syntax, selectors,
and specificity. We&#39;ll run through how to implement CSS below.

Create the CSS doc.
Just as we created our &quot;index.html&quot; file, we&#39;ll now create our &quot;style.css&quot; file to store
our CSS rules. Again, the name of the file does not matter, but you must include the
&quot;.css&quot; extension.
Add a CSS rule.
For now, we&#39;ll focus on adding one rule to our CSS file. In this case, I want all
paragraphs to display as red text.
The selector &quot;p&quot; is telling the CSS we want to target all paragraphs within our HTML
and apply the properties listed within the brackets ({}). In this case, we have one
property &quot;color&quot; that we have set to the value &quot;red,&quot; but we can add as many
properties under a rule as we want.
You may notice that nothing happens on the page after you&#39;ve added this CSS rule
to your file. That&#39;s because we need to link our HTML and CSS together, which we&#39;ll
show in the next section.
4. Put your HTML and CSS together.
For our CSS to affect our HTML, we need to tell the browser to apply the CSS. The
process to do this is straightforward. We simply need to add a &lt;link&gt; element to
our &lt;head&gt;.
Once again, we see HTML attributes in action. Adding the &lt;link&gt; tag without the &quot;rel&quot;
and &quot;href&quot; attributes would produce no results since the browser would not know the
link type (stylesheet) and where to link to (style.css). Note that if you have named
your CSS file differently, then the value for the href attribute within the quotes (&quot; &quot;)
should be updated to match your file name. Otherwise, the browser will not be able
to find your stylesheet.
More CSS Rules
Now that our HTML and CSS are linked, I will add more rules to make our page look
a bit less vanilla.
Let&#39;s review each of our new rules:
 Body rule: Transforms the background color of our body (AKA the visible
page) from white to light gray
 H1 rule: Reduces font size for our main page title
 Text class rule: Changes color of any element I tag with the &quot;class&quot; attribute to
green (overriding paragraph rule above it)
 Smiley id rule: Changes the width of my smiley face image to 300px and sets
the height to automatically scale
Note: Any class or id rules that you write in your HTML also means that you must tag
the specific elements that you want to target in your HTML with the corresponding
&quot;class&quot; or &quot;id&quot; attribute plus the name as written in our CSS.

5. Code a responsive website or a static website.
To understand web responsiveness, we will turn once again to a metaphor. On one
hand, we have a pond. The water inside the pond is always the same shape
because the edges of the pond never change. On the other hand, we have a stream.
The edges of the stream are always changing as it flows, and the water is always
expanding and narrowing to fit that shape.

We can think of static and responsive websites in the same way. The static website
does not react to a change in the browser&#39;s size. Its contents will always be the
same shape. Meanwhile, the responsive website constantly adapts to different
browser and screen sizes.
Why does responsiveness matter? In 2021, mobile traffic now makes up more than
55% of all traffic on the internet, according to  StatCounter . If your website can’t
accommodate traffic on small phone screens up to smart TVs, then you are losing
potential customers. Additionally, Google ranks mobile friendliness as part of its
decision to show pages in search results, so you can lose organic traffic as well.
Until now, we have created a static website. The text elements will resize by default,
but other elements will keep their original shape and size no matter how the display
changes. Below, we can see our smiley face&#39;s right side is cut off because the
viewport is now narrower than its fixed width of 300 pixels (note that our paragraph
has wrapped its text to fit).

Meta Viewport Tag
Before we continue, there&#39;s another tag we&#39;ll want to add to our &lt;head&gt; that is very
important:
The meta tag tells all browsers and devices to treat pixel measurements the same. In
other words, mobile devices and browsers will shrink your page to the same scale as
it would display on a desktop, which we can see below.

Obviously, this content is much too small for a phone screen, and the user will have
to zoom in to view it. So, adding the meta viewport tag to our &lt;head&gt; will standardize
scaling across all browsers and devices.
This is already looking better, and now we can be sure our page will behave
consistently across devices and screen sizes, which will save us a lot of frustration.
We can now optimize our web page for mobile using media queries and fluid design
practices.
Media Queries

A media query is a CSS rule that instructs the CSS to behave differently based on
the width of the viewport (AKA the screen/browser width the web page is displaying
in). You define that width and how the CSS changes.
For example, I&#39;ve increased our smiley face&#39;s width to 400 pixels so that it has more
presence on larger screens. However, I want to make sure it&#39;s not cut off on smaller
screens. So, I wrote a media query that states that once the screen is 400 pixels
wide or smaller, reduce the smiley face&#39;s width to 300 pixels.

I&#39;ve added the media query to the end of our CSS stylesheet. Make sure they always
come after your regular CSS rules and group them sequentially. For example, a 500
pixel-media query comes before a 400-pixel media query.
Fluid Design
Media queries work best if we want to keep our elements at fixed widths. As you saw
above, I wanted my smiley face to display as 400 pixels wide and then scale back to
300 pixels. However, what happens when the screen reaches a 300-pixel width? I
would need another media query to reduce its size again.
An alternative approach is fluid design, which is based on the use of relative units.
Until now, we&#39;ve been using an absolute unit: the pixel. No matter what happens on
the screen, a pixel is always the same exact unit of measurement. To give you a
sense of what that means, 96 pixels is equivalent to one inch, 192 pixels is
equivalent to two inches, etc.
Relative units are relative to the environment they&#39;re in. In our code, the environment
for the smiley face image element is the body, which is a container that spans the
entire page. The relative unit we&#39;ll use is the percentage to set my smiley face equal
to that proportion of the body&#39;s width. For example, if the body is 400 pixels wide and
the smiley face is set to 50% of the container&#39;s width, then it is 200 pixels wide.
Now I no longer need a media query; the smiley face will always scale to fill the
container to the amount specified. In other words, it&#39;s fluid. However, don&#39;t write
media queries off just yet.
Using Media Queries and Fluid Design
Though they may seem like opposites, media queries and fluid design pair well to
achieve responsiveness. A favorite trick of mine is to use the CSS property &quot;max-
width&quot; set to a maximum pixel count along with a &quot;width&quot; set to a percentage. Take
the example below.

I have my smiley face initially at a fixed width of 400 pixels. Then I scale it back to
300 pixels when the viewport reaches 400 pixels. Then I set it to a maximum width of
300 pixels but to scale down to always be 100% of the available width of the
container for any screens smaller than 300 pixels.

6. Code a simple website or an interactive website.
We will (you guessed it) bring back our friend the metaphor for this section. Imagine
you&#39;re standing on a street reading a flier for guitar lessons on a brick wall. You&#39;re
interested, and the flier says to call a number to sign up.
This is what we&#39;d consider a simple website. It displays information about something,
it may even ask you to take an action, but reading is the extent of what you (the
user) can do on the site. Remember, you need to call the number it gives you on
your phone.
We&#39;re back at the brick wall. Now, there&#39;s a sign talking about guitar lessons and a
door to enter the studio to sign up if you&#39;re interested. The wall is still displaying
information, but now you can interact with it to take the next step. This is what we&#39;d
consider an interactive website. See where the name comes from?
Unfortunately, it is outside of the scope of this lesson to dive into the syntax and
mechanics of JavaScript. Instead, I will provide a pre-written program so that we can
focus on implementing it within our website.
To summarize what&#39;s going on, we first tell our program to identify the smiley face
HTML element. Then, we attach an event listener that &quot;listens&quot; (looks for) a click
from the user on the image. Once that happens, it executes the action we&#39;ve defined,
which is known as the event listener function (or the reaction). In this case, the
program prints a welcome message to the screen from our smiley face.
Adding JavaScript to Your Page
The main method for adding JavaScript to our page is with the script tag which
wraps around our program. This tells the browser that we are adding JavaScript to
our page so our script isn&#39;t treated like more HTML. You can see this implemented
below.
It is a best practice to add the &lt;script&gt; element after all other content on the page.
The easiest way to do this is to add it right before the closing body tag. This ensures
that the content we are targeting (the smiley face) will be rendered before our
program looks for it. Otherwise, the smiley face would not be found and our program
would not work.
Next Steps in Building Your Website
If you have made it this far, then take a moment to congratulate yourself. You have
gone from perhaps never coding before to having the foundation of a website that is
both responsive and interactive. We&#39;ve covered a lot of ground between different
concepts in HTML and CSS and even touched on programming. This is a major first
step in your web development journey.

Of course there&#39;s still much to learn. I&#39;ve outlined a few areas to focus on as you
continue building your web development toolbox.
Keep learning HTML and CSS.
HTML and CSS have more complexity than what we&#39;ve covered today. These
languages form the visible face of your website and are critical to your users&#39;
experience. I&#39;ve relinked the foundational guides to HTML and CSS below as well as
added some links to more advanced CSS topics.
Foundational Guides:
 Ultimate Guide to HTML: a one-stop shop for everything you need to know to
write HTML like a pro
 Ultimate Guide to CSS: a one-stop shop to start using CSS to make your
website wow your visitors
Advanced CSS Topics:
 Float: a simplified method for arranging HTML elements to the left, right, or
center of a page
 Grid: a rigid layout system for arranging content on a page in rows and
columns that offers more customization than flexbox
 Flexbox: a fluid layout system for arranging content in rows or columns that is
simpler to implement than grid but offers less control over contents&#39; positions
 Animations: a method for adding flair to your page by animating HTML
elements for different motions or visual effects
Learn JavaScript.
HTML and CSS slightly outrank JavaScript in importance since there is no visible
web page without them. But JavaScript is crucial on its own. Without it, we would
only be able to look at websites; there would be no online banking, social media,
food delivery services, and all the other ways we have adapted the internet to meet
our needs. JavaScript allows us to implement programming tactics and add whole
new layers of interactivity to an otherwise static site.
Learn Git and GitHub.
Git is the most popular version control system in the industry. Version control
enables you to branch your code to test out changes while keeping the original code
(AKA source code) unchanged until you confirm your changes are good to deploy.
Think of it as making a copy of a Word file so you still have the original content if
something goes wrong. As your website grows in complexity, version control will
become more and more useful.
GitHub is the most popular code repository built around Git. It allows you to back up
your code to a cloud-hosted environment the same way you would back up your
photos to iCloud or Google Drive. Git and GitHub are also valuable tools to help you
collaborate on your code with others without overwriting each other&#39;s work.
As you can see, your learning has only just begun, but you now have a solid
foundation to better appreciate all that is to come. Stay curious, stay patient, and
practice your coding, and you will be amazed how quickly you grow to become a full
web developer. In less than three years, I went from knowing basic HTML to writing
this tutorial, so never doubt yourself. We can&#39;t wait to see what you do next.<br>

  <h3 class="w3-left">What is crypto mining?</h3>
  <p class="w3-left w3-small"> 
  Apps, websites and software required for mining
Crypto mining, however, also involves validating cryptocurrency transactions on
a blockchain network and adding them to a distributed ledger.  Most
importantly, crypto mining prevents the double-spending of digital currency on
a distributed network.
Like physical currencies, when one member spends cryptocurrency, the digital
ledger must be updatedby debiting one account and crediting the other. However,
the challenge of a digital currency is that digital platforms are easily manipulated.
Bitcoin’s distributed ledger, therefore, only allows verified miners to update
transactions on the digital ledger. This gives miners the extra responsibility of
securing the network from double-spending.
Meanwhile, new coins are generated to reward miners for their work in securing the
network. Since distributed ledgers lack a centralized authority, the mining process is
crucial for validating transactions. Miners are, therefore, incentivized to secure the
network by participating in the transaction validation process that increases their
chances of winning newly minted coins
In order to ensure that only verified crypto miners can mine and validate
transactions, a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus protocol has been put into place.
PoW also secures the network from any external attacks.

Proof-of-Work
Crypto mining is somewhat similar to mining precious metals. While miners of
precious metals will unearth gold, silver, or diamonds, crypto miners will trigger the
release of new coins into circulation. For miners to be rewarded with new coins, they
need to deploy machines that solve complex mathematical equations in the form
of cryptographic hashes. A hash is a truncated digital signature of a chunk of data.
Hashes are generated to secure data transferred on a public network. Miners
compete with their peers to zero in on a hash value generated by a crypto coin
transaction, and the first miner to crack the code gets to add the block to the ledger
and receive the reward.
Each block uses a hash function to refer to the previous block, forming an unbroken
chain of blocks that leads back to the first block. For this reason, peers on the
network can easily verify whether certain blocks are valid and whether the miners
who validated each block properly solved the hash to receive the reward.
Over time, as miners deploy more advanced machines to solve PoW, the difficulty of
 equations on the network increases. At the same time, competition among miners
rises, increasing the scarcity of the cryptocurrency as a result.

How to Start Mining Cryptocurrencies

Mining cryptocurrencies requires computers with special software specifically
designed to solve complicated, cryptographic mathematic equations. In the
technology’s early days, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could be mined with a simple
CPU chip on a home computer. Over the years, however, CPU chips have become
impractical for mining most cryptocurrencies due to the increasing difficulty levels.
Today, mining cryptocurrencies requires a specialized GPU or an application-specific
integrated circuit (ASIC) miner. In addition, the GPUs in the mining rig must be
connected to a reliable internet connection at all times. Each crypto miner is also
required to be a member of an online crypto mining pool as well.

Different Methods of Mining Cryptocurrencies
Different methods of mining cryptocurrencies require different amounts of time. In the
technology’s early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most
miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today
because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high
electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board.
GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes
computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For
GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig.
Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU
miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they
produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive,
meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete.
Given the ever-increasing costs of GPU  and ASIC mining, cloud mining is becoming
increasingly popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to leverage the power of
major corporations and dedicated crypto mining facilities.
Individual crypto miners can identify both free and paid cloud mining hosts online
and rent a mining rig for a specific amount of time. This method is the most hands-
free way to mine cryptocurrencies.
Mining Pools
Mining pools allow miners to combine their computational resources in order to
increase their chances of finding and mining blocks on a blockchain. If a mining pool
succeeds, the reward is distributed across the mining pool, in proportion to the
amount of resources that each miner contributed to the pool.
Most crypto mining applications come with a mining pool; however, crypto
enthusiasts now also join together online to create their own mining pools. Because
some pools earn more rewards than others, miners are free to change pools
whenever they need to.
Miners consider official crypto mining pools more reliable since they receive frequent
upgrades by their host companies, as well as regular technical support. The best

place to find mining pools is  CryptoCompare , where miners can compare different
mining pools based on their reliability, profitability, and the coin that they want to
mine.
Is Crypto Mining Worth It?
Determining whether crypto mining is worthwhile depends on several factors.
Whether a prospective miner chooses a CPU, GPU, ASIC miner, or cloud mining,
the most important factors to consider are the mining rig’s hash rate, electric power
consumption, and overall costs. Generally, crypto mining machines consume a
considerable amount of electricity and emit significant heat.
For instance, the average ASIC miner will use about 72 terawatts of power to create
a bitcoin in about ten minutes. These figures continue to change as technology
advances and mining difficulty increases.
Even though the price of the machine matters, it is just as important to consider
electricity consumption, electricity costs in the area, and cooling costs, especially
with GPU and ASIC mining rigs.
It is also important to consider the level of difficulty for the cryptocurrency that an
individual wants to mine, in order determine whether the operation would even be
profitable.
The Tax Implications of Crypto Mining
The taxation of crypto mining remains an important consideration.
Crypto miners will generally face tax consequences (1) when they are rewarded with
cryptocurrency for performing mining activities, and (2) when they sell or exchange
the reward tokens. With respect to (1), the IRS has issued Notice 2014-21 which
directly addresses the tax implications of crypto mining. Under the Notice, a miner
will recognize gross income upon receipt of the reward tokens in an amount equal to
the fair market value of the coins at the time of receipt. Additionally, if a
taxpayer’s mining activities constitute a trade or business or the taxpayer undertakes
such activities as an independent contractor, the reward tokens/virtual currency
payments are deemed to be self-employment income and accordingly, subject to
self-employment taxes. Similarly, if a taxpayer performs mining activities as an
employee, payments made in cryptocurrency are treated as wages subject to federal
income tax withholding of Social Security/Medicare and unemployment taxes.

Is Crypto Mining Legal?
Most jurisdictions and authorities have yet to enact laws governing cryptocurrencies,
meaning that, for most countries, the legality of crypto mining remains unclear.

Under the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), crypto miners are
considered money transmitters, so they may be subject to the laws that govern that
activity. In Israel, for instance, crypto mining is treated as a business and is subject
to corporate income tax. In India and elsewhere, regulatory uncertainty persists,
although Canada and the United States appear friendly to crypto mining.
However, apart from jurisdictions that have specifically banned cryptocurrency-
related activities, very few countries prohibit crypto mining.
Our Freeman Law Cryptocurrency Law Resource page provides a summary of the
legal status of cryptocurrency for each country across the globe with statutory or
regulatory provisions governing cryptocurrency.

Conclusion: The Sustainability of Crypto Mining
For aspiring crypto miners, curiosity and a strong desire to learn are simply a must.
The crypto mining space is constantly changing as new technologies emerge. The
professional miners who receive the best rewards are constantly studying the space
and optimizing their mining strategies to improve their performance.
On the other hand, climate change advocates have become increasingly concerned,
as more and more fossil fuels are burned to fuel the mining process.
Such concerns have pushed cryptocurrency communities like Ethereum to consider
switching from PoW frameworks to more sustainable frameworks, such as proof-of-
stake frameworks.
